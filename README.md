# First-React-App
This is my first basic react app.

Textz is the basic website for text utilities like convert to uppercase/lowercase,word count,clear extra space etc.
You can also change themes between light and dark.

I had also deploy this app using netlify.

Here is the link of the site...
https://textz.netlify.app/

Will try more useful and advanced apps or sites build using react in future for sure!
